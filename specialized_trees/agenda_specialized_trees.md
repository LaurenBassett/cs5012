### Review M5.2 Course Content 

**Binary Search Tree (BST)**  
Highly constrained (discuss)  
Very useful for searching data w expected runtime $O(log n)$  
Shortcomings: can get unbalanced, can produce worse case runtime $O(n)$

**Heap**  
Not useful for searching for data values  
Useful for finding max (max heap) or min (min heap)  
More constraints than BST: shape and order properties  
Can be stored in an array
