    "1) When instructions ask for a case insensitive match on a word or phrase, any mix of uppercase and lowercase characters are a match.  \n",
    "2) The regexes do not need to be robust generally. They simply need to find all the matches in the documents. For example, when matching dollar amounts,  \n",
    "   the regex does not need to guard against matching invald forms such as $61,0 as they are not in the documents. \n",
