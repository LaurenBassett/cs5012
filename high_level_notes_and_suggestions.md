### Notes for Students and Instructors

**Challenges**  
The most challenging thing for students has been the breadth of coverage in the time available.  
The course developers chose to cover a vast array of topics, some in detail.  
**Focusing your attention on the Learning Outcomes will help on assessment items.**  
Example: while many sort algorithms are discussed, Merge Sort is a focus.

**Big Ideas**
- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Concepts of Databases

**Cumulative Knowledge**  
Some topics, such as time complexity, come up repeatedly in the course. 

**In Class Activities (ICAs)**  
Live Sessions include 15-20 mins for ICAs where students work in small groups. 

**Coding Prerequisites**  
Make sure you really understand implementing these items in Python:
- data types
- functions
- classes

Make sure you understand how recursion works. This comes up often, particularly with tree structures.

**Academic Honesty**  
Each student writes their own code in assignments.
