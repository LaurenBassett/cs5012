### Review M2.2 Course Content 

**Sorting**  
Many differents algos and approaches presented
sorting is often a first step to search (binary search)

**Merge sort**  
divide-and-conquer algo
one of the most efficient sorting algorithms  
good time complexity in worst and average cases: O(n log n)  
pay close attention to this algo

Not necessary to memorize how each of the sorting algos work.  
Develop an understanding how to measure time complexity for the different search, sort algorithms.

**Contiguous (Array) vs Non-contiguous (Chain) data structures**

**Array**  
size: specified in advance  
data accessed: directly by using pointer arithmetic

**Chain**  
size: not specified in advance  
data accessed: only by traversing the list

Python lists are implemented as dynamic arrays
