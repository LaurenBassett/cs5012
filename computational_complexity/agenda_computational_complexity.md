### Q & A

---  
### Review M1.2 Analysis of Algorithms

#### Important Ideas:

**Time complexity**  
Is this algorithm good? Are there better ones?

Understand the characteristics of efficient and effective algorithms

**Asymptotic Analysis with Big-O notation**  

Will probably bring your brain back to Calculus and computing limits!  

Use Big-O notation for communicating time complexity of algorithms
